# Best-Takeaway-in-London?

Half passion, half proof of concept. This project scrapes takeaway food restaurants from justeat, aggregates the reviews and maps them on a plotly dashboard with dropdown menus for location and cuisine.

I've also created a self service tool within the 'Topic Modelling' notebook to assess the topics of conversation within the restaurant reviews.
