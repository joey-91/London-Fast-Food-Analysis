# Best-Takeaway-in-London?
This project scrapes takeaway restaurants from justeat, aggregates the reviews and maps them on a plotly dashboard with dropdown menus for location and cuisine.

I've also created a self service tool within the 'Topic Modelling' notebook which essentially builds an unsupervised model to cluster the reviews into a specified number of categories based on how different they are.
